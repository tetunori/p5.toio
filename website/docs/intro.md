## What is p5.toio?
**p5.toio** is a library for [toio™](https://toio.io/) in p5.js environment. A lot of APIs on toio can be used with just simple steps as we see later. Now, we have `beta-version(0.8.0)`.

By using this library, we can start immediately controlling toio™Core Cube like sample below. Please refer to [Environment](https://tetunori.github.io/p5.toio/docs/env) for the system requirements.  
**[OpenProcessing: p5.toio Basic Sample](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1716366)**  

### How to play samples on OpenProcessing
1. Turn a toio™Core Cube on.
2. Open sample URL and click/tap on Canvas.
    1. p5.toio samples mostly use `mouseClicked` to connect.
3. Select a Cube from a list.

## Class Structure
**p5.toio** consists of 2 classes `P5tCube` and `P5tId`. `P5tCube` class supplies a lot of APIs and utilities enable us to control toio™Core Cube easily. Please refer to the `P5tCube` class interfaces from [here](https://tetunori.github.io/p5.toio/docs/cube/classes/p5tcube/). `P5tId` class includes APIs and properties on toioIDs printed on toio™'s mats, cards, stickers and so on. See interfaces from [here](https://tetunori.github.io/p5.toio/docs/id/classes/p5tid/) for `P5tId`.
