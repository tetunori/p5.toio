## What is p5.toio?
**p5.toio** is a library for [toioâ„¢](https://toio.io/) in p5.js environment. A lot of APIs on toio can be used with just simple steps as we see later. Now I released an `alpha-version(0.5.0)` so that there is no test code, detailed API document or samples yet. Please wait for the next `beta-version(0.8.0)` releaseðŸ˜‰.

By using this library, we can start immediately controlling toioâ„¢Core Cube like sample below. Please refer to [Environment](https://tetunori.github.io/p5.toio/docs/env) for the system requirements.  
**[p5.js Web Editor: p5.toio basic sample](https://editor.p5js.org/tetunori/sketches/x-m5aIlWp)**  

### How to play samples on p5.js Web Editor
1. Turn a toioâ„¢Core Cube on.
2. Open sample URL and click `Play` button.
3. Click `Preview` region then the dialog will launch.
4. Select a Cube displayed.
  1. p5.toio samples mostly use `mouseClick` to connect.

## Class Structure
**p5.toio** consists of 2 classes `P5tCube` and `P5tId`. `P5tCube` class supplies a lot of APIs and utilities enable us to control toioâ„¢Core Cube easily. Please refer to the `P5tCube` class interfaces from [here](https://tetunori.github.io/p5.toio/docs/cube/classes/p5tcube/). `P5tId` class includes APIs and properties on toioIDs printed on toioâ„¢'s mats, cards, stickers and so on. See interfaces from [here](https://tetunori.github.io/p5.toio/docs/id/classes/p5tid/) for `P5tId`.
