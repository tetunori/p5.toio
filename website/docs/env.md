Due to the dependency to `Web Bluetooth`, this library works with the following environment.  
*See the latest status in detail from [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-bluetooth) and [WebBluetoothCG](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/master/implementation-status.md).*
- OS: Windows, macOS, Android. **Not support iOS/iPadOS**. 
- Browser: Google Chrome is highly recommended.

Also, some Web Editor like [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) support this library. We often use this environment for samples.
:::note
[OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/) unfortunately does not support `Web Bluetooth` so that this library also does not workðŸ˜­.
