*See the latest status in detail from [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-bluetooth) and [WebBluetoothCG](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/master/implementation-status.md).*
- OS: Windows, macOS, Android. **iOS/iPadOS does not support**(Please use [Bluefy](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055) app instead). 
- Browser: Latest version of Google Chrome is highly recommended.

Also, some Web Editor like [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/) support this library. We use this environment for samples.
